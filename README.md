# Pokedex CLI üéÆ

A simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) Pokedex project built as part of the Boot.dev backend curriculum. This interactive program allows users to explore the world of Pok√©mon through a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Players can visit different Pok√©mon areas, try to catch Pok√©mon, and inspect their stats. 

## Features

- **Explore Areas**: Visit various Pok√©mon habitats and discover which Pok√©mon can be found there.
- **Catch Pok√©mon**: Attempt to catch Pok√©mon you encounter. Success is not guaranteed!
- **View Caught Pok√©mon**: See all the Pok√©mon you've successfully caught.
- **Inspect Pok√©mon**: View detailed stats for any Pok√©mon in your collection.
- **Help Command**: Displays a list of available commands and how to use them.

## Commands

Use the following commands to interact with the CLI:

- `map` & `mapb`: Visit a Pok√©mon area to discover new Pok√©mon.
- `catch <pokemon_name>`: Try to catch the specified Pok√©mon.
- `inspect <pokemon_name>`: View detailed stats for a specific Pok√©mon in your collection.
- `pokedex`: List all Pok√©mon you've caught so far.
- `help`: Display a list of all available commands and their descriptions.
- `exit`: Exit the CLI.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokedex-cli.git
   cd pokedex-cli

2. Build and run the CLI:

   ```

3. Use the commands listed in the **Commands** section to explore, catch, and inspect Pok√©mon!

## Project Purpose

This project was built to practice CLI development, working with REPLs, and managing game-like logic in a Go program. It demonstrates fundamental skills in interactive programming, data handling, and user experience in a text-based environment.
